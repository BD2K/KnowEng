The research goal of the Center is to build and publicly deploy KnowEnG–a Knowledge Engine for Genomics–that will allow
users to perform community knowledge-guided analysis of their data. KnowEnG will differ from existing environments for
knowledge-based analysis in that user-supplied data sets will be analyzed in the context of existing knowledge, rather
than by post facto asking questions about genes selected using standard analytical techniques.
